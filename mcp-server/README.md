# MCP Server: Natural Language Cloud Cost Estimation

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300.png?text=MCP+Server)

**Query your cloud costs in plain English.**

MCP Server is a project aimed at providing a simple, natural language interface for querying cloud cost and usage data from major providers like AWS and Azure. Instead of navigating complex dashboards and APIs, you can simply ask questions like:

- *"What were our EC2 costs last month?"*
- *"How much did we spend on Azure storage in the last quarter?"*
- *"Project our spending for the next 6 months based on current trends."*

## üöÄ Project Status: Inception

This project is in the very early stages of development. The basic project structure has been bootstrapped, and the core technologies are being defined. We are actively working on building the foundation for this exciting tool.

## ‚ú® Features (Planned)

-   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understand and process user queries in plain English.
-   **Multi-Cloud Support:** Connect to both AWS and Azure for comprehensive cost analysis.
-   **Cost Estimation & Forecasting:** Provide current cost data and predict future spending.
-   **REST API:** Expose a simple API for integration with other tools and dashboards.
-   **Secure Credential Management:** Safely store and manage cloud provider credentials.
